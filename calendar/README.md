### A self-improving sarcastic minimalistic app

An app for minimizing your late-to-an-event timing. 
It controls, using a cronjob, when you are effectively late, certifying it with a timestamp, and eventually
bullying you with CAPSLOCKs to make you speed up. Pre-pre-alpha.

Major possible improvements:
- an in-memory database that can be a permanent remembrance of every time you were late (:
