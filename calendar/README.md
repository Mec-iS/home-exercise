# calendar-furiere

An app for minimizing your late-to-an-event timing. 
It controls, using a cronjob, when you are effectively late, certifying it with a timestamp, and eventually
bullying you with the aim of making you run to be as soon as possible present at the event. Pre-pre-alpha.

Major possible improvements:
- an in-memory database that can be a permanent remembrance of every time you were late (:
